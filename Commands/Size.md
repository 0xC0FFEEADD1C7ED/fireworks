A collection of commands to resize objects.

If multiple objects are selected, each one will be transformed independently.

All Size commands support math operations, so you can quickly make an object 23 pixels wider, or half its height, or...

**Bonus points:** if the selected object is a Text box, you can use a width of '0' to have it automatically resize to fit the content without wrapping.
