This command will ask you for the filename and folder location, and is specially built for @plumilla.\r\n\r\n- **Current Page as PNG 24**  (CTRL + SHIFT + X)\r\n  \r\n  Exports the current page as a flattened (non editable) PNG file with a 24 bits color depth. The file is saved in the same folder as the current file, with the page name added to the current file name.\r\nI.e: if your file is called CoolDesign.png, and the current page is called 'Home', the command creates a file named CoolDesign_Home.png\r\n\r\n- **Slices as CSS Sprite**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Exports the slices in the current document as a .css file.  \r\nThis way, you can use your PNG file as a sprite.\r\n\r\n### Export Settings\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Set PNG 24 for All Pages**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  A command to set the export format of all pages as PNG in 24 bits (something that is currently *so* time consuming and convoluted that it makes you want to cry)\r\n\r\n- **Set PNG 32 for All Pages**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  A command to set the export format of all pages as PNG in 32 bits (something that is currently *so* time consuming and convoluted that it makes you want to cry)\r\n\r\n### Grids\r\nCommands to create grids using guides (the commands formerly known as \"Reticulator\")\r\n\r\n- **Baseline**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Creates an horizontal typographyc baseline.\r\n\r\n- **Reticulator 950-12-10**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Creates a 950 pixels wide layout, with 12 columns and a 10 px gutter.\r\n\r\n- **Reticulator 951-16-9**  (CTRL + SHIFT + R)\r\n  \r\n  Creates a 951 pixels wide layout, with 16 columns and a 9 px gutter.\r\n\r\n- **Reticulator Horizontal**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Creates a grid using horizontal guides.\r\n\r\n- **Reticulator**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Creates a grid using vertical guides. It asks for the layout width, the number of columns, and the gutter width. If you have a selected object, the command will use its current position as the starting position of the grid, and its width as the default layout width.\r\n\r\n### Guides\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Around Selection**  (CTRL + SHIFT + W)\r\n  \r\n  Creates four guides that frame the currently selected objects.\r\n\r\n- **Clear All**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Removes all guides from the current page.\r\n\r\n- **Clear Horizontal**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Removes all horizontal guides from the current page.\r\n\r\n- **Clear Vertical**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Removes all vertical guides from the current page.\r\n\r\n- **Copy from Master Page**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Copies the guides from the master page to the current one.\r\n\r\n- **Copy from Page**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Asks for a page number, and copies the guides from that page to the current one.\r\n\r\n- **Copy to Page**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Asks for a page number, and copies the guides from the current page to that one.\r\n\r\n- **Copy**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Copies the guides from the current page.\r\n\r\n- **Paste**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Pastes the guides copied with the \"Guides » Copy\" command (works accross documents!).\r\n\r\n### Layers\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Unlock All**  (CTRL + SHIFT + U)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n### Pages\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Add Page**  (CTRL + SHIFT + N)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n- **DeNumberize**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Removes the page number added by the Numberize command.\r\n\r\n- **Duplicate Current**  (CTRL + SHIFT + D)\r\n  \r\n  Duplicates the current page and sets it as the current page.\r\n\r\n- **Go To Master Page**  (CTRL + SHIFT + M)\r\n  \r\n  The Pages » Go To Master Page command acts as a toggle: run it when in a page and it takes you to the master page.

This command was born out of frustration with the way page names are edited in Fireworks CS3. If your page names have more than 10 characters, it's really hard not to get crazy editing names :)\r\n\r\n- **Sort**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Sorts the pages in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n- **Vertical Trim All Pages**  (CTRL + SHIFT + T)\r\n  \r\n  Trims all pages vertically, fitting the contents.

It does not modify the width of the page.  \r\n\r\n### Position\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Fix Position**  (CTRL + F)\r\n  \r\n  This command tries to fix a nasty bug where Fireworks will draw an item at a subpixel position. The command also tries to fix the width and height of the item so that they become integer numbers. Why Adobe thought it would be useful to draw using half pixels is beyond me...\r\n\r\n- **Set Position**  (CTRL + P)\r\n  \r\n  It asks for the new position in x,y coordinates.\r\n\r\n- **Swap**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Swaps the position of two selected objects.\r\n\r\n### Properties\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Set Rectangle Roundness in Pixels**  (CTRL + R)\r\n  \r\n  Sets the selection corner roundness in pixels (something that is not possible in CS3). Useful when you want to set the same roundness in a collection of rectangles with different sizes.\r\nThis command only makes sense for CS3, as CS4 lets you specify roundness in pixels.\r\n\r\n### Select\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Text Objects**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Selects all text objects in the current page.\r\nExtremely useful when you need to change the font for all text in a page.\r\n\r\n### Size\r\nA collection of commands to resize objects.\r\n\r\nIf multiple objects are selected, each one will be transformed independently.\r\n\r\nAll Size commands support math operations, so you can quickly make an object 23 pixels wider, or half its height, or...\r\n\r\n**Bonus points:** if the selected object is a Text box, you can use a width of '0' to have it automatically resize to fit the content without wrapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Height +1**  (CTRL + DOWN)\r\n  \r\n  Increment selected object’s height by 1 pixel.\r\n\r\n- **Height +10**  (CTRL + SHIFT + DOWN)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n- **Height -1**  (CTRL + UP)\r\n  \r\n  Decrease selected object’s height by 1 pixel.\r\n\r\n- **Height -10**  (CTRL + SHIFT + UP)\r\n  \r\n  Decrease selected object's height by 10 pixels.\r\n\r\n- **Height**  (CTRL + H)\r\n  \r\n  Sets the height of the selection.\r\n\r\n- **Scale to 16-9**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  This command scales the selected object(s) so that they have a 16:9 aspect ratio.\r\n\r\n- **Scale to 4-3**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  This command scales the selected object(s) so that they have a 4:3 aspect ratio.\r\n\r\n- **Scale to Height**  (CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + H)\r\n  \r\n  This command scales the selected object(s) proportionally so that they have the specified height while maintaining their aspect ratio.\r\n\r\n- **Scale to Width**  (CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + W)\r\n  \r\n  This command scales the selected object(s) proportionally so that they have the specified width while maintaining their aspect ratio.\r\n\r\n- **Set Size**  (CTRL + S)\r\n  \r\n  Sets selected object’s size. It asks for the width and height in w,h format. Supports math operations.\r\n\r\n- **Width +1**  (CTRL + RIGHT)\r\n  \r\n  Increment selected object’s width by 1 pixel.\r\n\r\n- **Width +10**  (CTRL + SHIFT + RIGHT)\r\n  \r\n  Increment selected object’s width by 10 pixels.\r\n\r\n- **Width -1**  (CTRL + LEFT)\r\n  \r\n  Decrease selected object’s width by 1 pixel.\r\n\r\n- **Width -10**  (CTRL + SHIFT + LEFT)\r\n  \r\n  Decrease selected object’s width by 10 pixels.\r\n\r\n- **Width**  (CTRL + W)\r\n  \r\n  Sets the width of the selection.\r\n\r\n### Text\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Arialize Selection**  (CTRL + A)\r\n  \r\n  Sets currently selected text blocks to Arial.\r\n\r\n- **Autokern Toggle**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Toggles the 'Auto kern' property of selected text objects.\r\n\r\n- **Bulletize with…**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Adds a custom bullet sign in front of every line in the selected text box(es).\r\n\r\n- **Bulletize**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Adds a bullet sign (•) in front of every line in the selected text box(es).\r\n\r\n- **Disable Antialias**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Disable text antialiasing in all pages of the current document.\r\n\r\n- **Fix Faux Bolds**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Replaces fake bold text with proper Bold family in Fireworks CS4 & CS5\r\n\r\n- **Join with…**  (CTRL + SHIFT + J)\r\n  \r\n  Creates a new text object containing the selected text objects’ content, joined by the desired character.\r\n\r\n- **Join**  (CTRL + J)\r\n  \r\n  Creates a new text object containing the selected text objects’ content.\r\nEach content is added on a new line.\r\n\r\n- **Verdanize Selection**  (No shortcut)\r\n  \r\n  Sets currently selected text blocks to Verdana.\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"doing less for fun and profit","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
