# Fireworks

These are my commands and libraries for Adobe Fireworks.

## Commands

### Alpha
A collection of commands to change an object's alpha. They work on the currently selected object(s).

#### Shortcuts
  * &#x2303; + 1 — 10% Alpha
  * &#x2303; + 2 — 20% Alpha
  * &#x2303; + 3 — 30% Alpha
  * &#x2303; + 4 — 40% Alpha
  * &#x2303; + 5 — 50% Alpha
  * &#x2303; + 6 — 60% Alpha
  * &#x2303; + 7 — 70% Alpha
  * &#x2303; + 8 — 80% Alpha
  * &#x2303; + 9 — 90% Alpha
  * &#x2303; + 0 — 100% Alpha

### Color
Two commands to change an object's fill and stroke color.

#### Shortcuts
* &#x2303; + C — Set Fill Color
* &#x2303; + &#x21E7; + C — Set Stroke Color
* &#x2303; + &#x2325; + C — Set Canvas Color

### Effects
Right now there's just one command: Reflection. It creates a "wet floor" reflection of the currently selected object(s).

### Export
A command to export the current page as a PNG in 24 bits.

#### Shortcuts
* &#x2303; + &#x21E7; + X — Export Current Page as 24 bits PNG

### Export Settings
A command to set the export format of all pages as PNG in 24 bits.

### Grids
Commands to create grids using guides (aka Reticulator)

#### Shortcuts
* &#x2303; + &#x21E7; + R — Create 951/16/9 Grid

### Guides
Commands to manage guides. The "Around Selection" creates four guides that frame the currently selected object.

#### Shortcuts
* &#x2303; + &#x21E7; + W — Create Guides Around Selection


### Position
Sets the selection position on stage.

#### Shortcuts
* &#x2303; + P — Set Position

### Select
Just one command that selects all Text objects in the page.

### Size
A collection of commands to resize objects. I bind them to Control + Arrows for 1 pixel increments and Control + Shift + Arrows for 10 pixel increments.

There's also three commands to set the size of the currently selected objects with numbers: **Size**, **Width** and **Height**. I bind them to Control + S, Control + W and Control + W.

All Size commands support math operations, so you can quickly make an object 23 pixels wider, or half its height, or...

Bonus points: if the selected object is a Text box, you can use a width of '0' to have it automatically resize to fit the content without wrapping.
