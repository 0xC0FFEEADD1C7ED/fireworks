## Alpha

A collection of commands to change an object's alpha. They work on the currently selected object(s). If the selection is a group, the transparency is changed for the whole group.

<% (1..10).each do |alpha| %>
- **Alpha <%= alpha * 10 %>** (Ctrl + <%= alpha < 10 ? alpha : 0 %>)
  
  Set the selected objects' alpha to <%= alpha * 10 %>%
<% end %>

## Color

Commands to change an object's fill and stroke color. When pressing the shortcut, a color picker will appear at the mouse pointer's position, allowing you to pick a color quite fast.

- **Canvas Color** (Ctrl + Alt + C)
  
  Set Canvas Color

- **Fill Color** (Ctrl + C)
  
  Set fill color. If the selection is a group, every object inside the group will be filled with the selected color. If the selected object has a gradient fill, it will be replaced with a solid fill.

- **Stroke Color** (Ctrl + Shift + C)
  
  Set stroke color.


## Effects

- **Reflection**
  
  It creates a "wet floor" reflection of the currently selected object(s). The command asks for the reflection's height.


## Export

- **Current Page as a PNG 24** (Ctrl + Shift + X)
  
  Exports the current page as a flattened (non editable) PNG file with a 24 bits color depth. The file is saved in the same folder as the current file, with the page name added to the current file name.
  
  I.e: if your file is called CoolDesign.png, and the current page is called 'Home', the command creates a file named CoolDesign_Home.png


## Export Settings

- **Set PNG 24 for All Pages**

  A command to set the export format of all pages as PNG in 24 bits (something that is currently *so* time consuming and convoluted that it makes you want to cry)

## Grids

Commands to create grids using guides (aka Reticulator)

- **Reticulator**
  
  Creates a grid using vertical guides. It asks for the layout width, the number of columns, and the gutter width. If you have a selected object, the command will use its current position as the starting position of the grid, and its width as the default layout width.

- **Reticulator 950-12-10**
  
  Creates a 950 pixels wide layout, with 12 columns and a 10 px gutter.

- **Reticulator 951-16-9** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
  
  Creates a 951 pixels wide layout, with 16 columns and a 9 px gutter.


## Guides
Commands to manage guides. The "Around Selection" creates four guides that frame the currently selected object.

**Shortcuts**

- &#x2303; + &#x21E7; + W — Create Guides Around Selection

## Pages

- Set Page Name ( Ctrl + Shift + P)
  
  Sets the current page name to whatever you write on the prompt window.


## Position
Sets the selection position on stage.

**Shortcuts**

- &#x2303; + P — Set Position

  It asks for the new position in x,y coordinates.

- &#x2303; + F — Fix Position.

  This command tries to fix a nasty bug where Fireworks will draw an item at a subpixel position. The command also tries to fix the width and height of the item.


## Properties
Changes to object properties.

**Shortcuts**

- &#x2303; + R — Set Rectangle Roundness in Pixels (supports multiple selections)


## Select
Just one command that selects all Text objects in the page. It selects objects inside groups, so you can use it to change the font on *every* text box on a page.

## Size
A collection of commands to resize objects.

All Size commands support math operations, so you can quickly make an object 23 pixels wider, or half its height, or...

Bonus points: if the selected object is a Text box, you can use a width of '0' to have it automatically resize to fit the content without wrapping.

**Shortcuts**

- &#x2303; + &#x2192; — Increment width by 1 pixel
- &#x2303; + &#x21E7; + &#x2192; — Increment width by 10 pixels
- &#x2303; + &#x2190; — Decrement width by 1 pixel
- &#x2303; + &#x21E7; + &#x2190; — Decrement width by 10 pixels
- &#x2303; + &#x2193; — Increment height by 1 pixel
- &#x2303; + &#x21E7; + &#x2193; — Increment height by 10 pixels
- &#x2303; + &#x2191; — Decrement height by 1 pixel
- &#x2303; + &#x21E7; + &#x2191; — Decrement height by 10 pixels
- &#x2303; + S — Set Size (width,height)
- &#x2303; + W — Set Width
- &#x2303; + H — Set Height


## Text
Text operations

**Shortcuts**

- &#x2303; + A — Arialize selection (sets currently selected text blocks to Arial)
